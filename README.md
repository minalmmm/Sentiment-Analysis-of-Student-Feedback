# Student Feedback Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze student feedback about teaching methods and materials. The goal is to identify areas for improvement and understand the sentiments expressed in the feedback.

---

## Project Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gather feedback from students in a structured CSV file (`Student_Feedback.csv`).

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, removing special characters, and converting text to lowercase.

3. **Text Cleaning**  
   - Use NLP techniques to remove stop words, punctuation, and non-alphabetic characters.
   - Tokenize the feedback text into meaningful words.

4. **Saving Cleaned Data**  
   - Save the cleaned and preprocessed dataset to a file for further analysis.

- Visualize feedback patterns using word clouds and bar plots.
- Create dashboards for summarizing insights.
